# Interview Questions
Questions I've encountered in different software engineering interviews.

### Computer Science and Algorithm Related
1. What is a hashmap and what is the look up time?
2. What is a stack? What is a queue?
3. Explain the heap data structure.
4. What is the time complexity of merge sort?
5. Given an array, return YES or NO if there is a place to split the array where the sum of both sides is equal.
6. Given a collection of Russian dolls, if one doll is smaller than another, it can fit inside the larger one. If dolls are of equal size neither can be placed inside the other. Imagine the number of dolls is given to you in an array such that each number in the array is representative of the size of the doll. Return the total number of dolls left after you have placed all possible smaller ones inside any larger ones. i.e.
    * [2,2,3,3] returns 2 dolls because each 2 can fit inside a 3
    * [1,2,2,3,4,5] returns 2 dolls because 1, one of the 2s, 3, and 4 can all fit inside of 5, leaving just 2 and 5. 
7. Given a list of items that each have a category and value, create a function that outputs each category with it's corresponding values sorted in alphabetical order. i.e.
    * output: 'category: item1, item2, item3...'
